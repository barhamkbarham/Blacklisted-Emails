Attn: Beneficiary.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has received a mandated payment authorization letter from the U.S government under the supervision of the FBI to release your delayed inheritance/ contract fund worth 10.5m USD to you. Note that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury that collects and analyzes information about financial transactions in order to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.

Meanwhile, due to the issues facing global inheritance payments in demanding different kinds of documents by the impostors before the successful completion of your funds release, we have decided to release your fund through the fastest mode of payment which is Automated Teller Machine (ATM Card) unless you opt in for another mode of payment. 

Be informed that your fund was also approved by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. As you may know, The U.S. Government Accountability Office is the supreme audit institution of the federal government of the United States while The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks. It also supervises the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The endorsements will enable us to facilitate your payment and conduct the immediate release of your fund within seven (7) office working days as soon as you meet up with compliance as follows:-
